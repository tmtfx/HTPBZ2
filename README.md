Haiku TAR Parallel-BZip2 Compressor / Decompressor

This is a simple tool to compress and decompress files with tar and a parallelized BZip2 passage.
While compressing, this app will add to the compressed file, the selected files and dirs along with their attributes.
If you use this tool to decompress the tar-bzipped2 file, the attributes will be restored to their relative files.
